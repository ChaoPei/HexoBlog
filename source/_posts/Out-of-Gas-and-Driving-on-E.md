### 1.Summary

With the rapid increase of electric vehicle, the development mode of charging station has attracted all circles attention. In this paper, we aim to construct a model to find a more reasonable network of charging stations. 

First, according the time series prediction model of the three indexes, the estimated electric vehicle proportion reached 80% in 2034. Therefore, Tesla is on track to allow a complete switch to all-electric in the US. The queuing theory model is applied to obtain the peak flow rate of charging station, and the quantity planning model of charging pile is established. There are 67,000 super charging stations and 114,000 destination charging piles. With the asymmetric Nash negotiation model, considering the regional feature factors, the share of urban, suburban and rural charging stations was 60.55%, 27.81% and 11.64%, with the asymmetric Nash negotiation model. 

Second , for super charging pile location problem based on the minimum circle and Voronoi map algorithm of maximum coverage model, combined with site location model in the Floyd the short-circuit algorithm, using the Python programming for Ireland charging pile distribution throughout the country. Then, according to the operation analysis model of charging pile, the proposal of investment charging pile is put forward.Finally, we analyze the elasticity coefficient relationship between the growth rate of automobile and GDP growth rate, and introduce Bass model to propose the Irish electric vehicle timeline. 

Third, it proposed to revise the cosine similarity function to determine whether network of charging stations still adapt to other countries. Then we use the characteristic factors of each region to establish the DAGSVM multi-category classification system.Finally, we give development and investment advice to different categories of countries. 

Fourth, we analyzed the impact of emerging technologies on the development model of electric vehicles from factors such as technical economy, environmental pollution, infrastructure and geographical conditions. 

Finally, we construct the sensitivity analysis of the prediction model and use the ROC curve to test the reliability of the DAGSVM classification model.The analysis shows that the model is feasible and reasonable which can accommodate to various situations 

Key words:Time Series Model, Asymmetrical Nash Negotiation Model, Maximum Coverage Model, DAGSVM Classifier.
